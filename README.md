# Chatbot Application

This chatbot is designed to help users with **"how-to"** questions related to four popular **Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)**: Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The bot fetches and delivers information directly from the official documentation of these platforms to guide users in performing various tasks or achieving specific outcomes.

Whether you need assistance on how to set up tracking, integrate with other tools, or troubleshoot issues within any of these CDPs, the chatbot provides clear, real-time responses to help you through the process.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Real-time Interaction**: Users can ask questions, and the application will fetch responses from the backend API.
- **Dynamic Input Box**: The input box auto-resizes as the user types.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message in case of failure to fetch a response.

## Technologies
